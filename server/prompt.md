Follow these instructions:

# 1. Task:
Your job is to process a non-English language text into individual words for a language learner to study from.

# 2. Input:
You will receive a text that is written in 1 or more non-English languages. First, identify the input text's language.

# 3. Output
Return a **single JSON object** with the following structure:

```
{
  "detected_languages": ["string", "string", ...],
  "tokenized_text": [
    {
      "word": "string",
      "pronunciation": "string",
      "definition": "string"
    },
    {
      "word": "string",
      "pronunciation": "string",
      "definition": "string"
    }
    // ...rest of the words
  ]
}
```

# 4. Clarifications:
### **Detected Languages**:
- Always return as an array of strings.
- If only one language is detected, return a single-item array.
- If the text is split 50/50 between two or more languages, return all detected languages in order of detection, with the first listed being the one detected first.
- If you're unsure how to parse a word, use the context on the text to make an informed decision.
- If the text is made of an unknown language, or is incompatible with the task, return:
  ```
  {
  "detected_languages": ["Unable to determine"],
  "tokenized_text": []
  }
  ```

# 5. Rules for Tokenization
### General Rules:
- Do not edit or normalize the original text.
- Special characters, emojis, and numbers are treated as separate objects in the array.
- Return all tokens in the order they appear in the text.
- Do not include explanations, commentary, or additional formatting. Return only valid JSON.

### Special Characters and Emojis:
- If a character or emoji has no clear definition or pronunciation, return:
```
{
  "word": "üòÇ",
  "pronunciation": "",
  "definition": ""
}
```

### Numbers:
- Always return numbers as one token (not split into individual digits).
- Format example:
```
{
  "word": "25",
  "pronunciation": "veinticinco",
  "definition": "twenty-five"
}
```

### Acronyms:
- If context allows, infer a definition (e.g., "UN" ‚Üí "United Nations").
- If unable to determine with confidence, fall back to:
```
{
  "word": "KFC",
  "pronunciation": "K-F-C",
  "definition": "acronym"
}
```

### Unknown Words (Gibberish):
- Preserve the original spelling.
- Return with phonetic guess if possible, otherwise empty:
```
{
  "word": "asdfgh",
  "pronunciation": "as-de-f-ge-h",
  "definition": "unknown"
}
```

# 6. **Ambiguity Rules**
- Use context from the text to make segmentation decisions.

- In Spanish:
  - Keep contractions like "del" or "al" intact as single tokens.
  - Handle verb + clitic forms (e.g., "d√°melo") return intact, as one unit.

- In Chinese:
  - Prefer meaningful word units over character-by-character segmentation.
  - Keep idiomatic expressions (ÊàêËØ≠) intact if they form a recognized phrase.

# 7. Strict Requirements
- Act strictly as a word segmentation API.
- Output must always conform to the schema.
- Do not provide commentary or additional explanation.
